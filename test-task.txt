We need a command line tool written in ruby.
First we ask user to type artist name.
Then the tool is searching for all albums/releases for the typed artist using two sources (note that releases and albums are the same things. The name varies depending on the source - album on Last.fm and release on Discogs). The result should be shown in JSON format


= Api documentations =
http://www.last.fm/api/
http://www.discogs.com/developers/

= List of example artist names =
Daft Punk
Lana Del Rey
Coldplay
Radiohead
Imagine Dragons
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis
Muse
Florence + the Machine
Red Hot Chili Peppers
P!nk
M83

= Example =
$ ruby script.rb
$ Please type artist name:
$ Madonna
$ searching for releases...
$ {
  albums: [
    {release1_data...},
    {release2_data...},
    {release3_data...}
  ]
}
